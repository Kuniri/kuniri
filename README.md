# What is Kuniri?

> Briefly, the main goal of Kuniri is: parse any kind of language, and generate
a common model file with code information. We believe that Kuniri can be a base
tool for other tools, like diagram generator, traceability, code quality,
documentation, and so forth. Initially, the main objective of Kuniri was to
provide a way to dynamically generate diagrams and traceability based on code.
However, the parser proved much more useful for many other kinds of
applications; thus, the focus shifted to the parser creation.

> Kuniri will inspect the source code, and extract information to generate a
final output. This file is a XML file (and other types in the near future), and
follows a strong pattern. This feature gives flexibility to other tools read the
file and process anything they want.

> Additionally, Kuniri was designed to grow to two main directions: support for
different languages, and provide ways to select which kind of information to
extract from the code.

## What is the the meaning of kuniri?

> Kuniri is an Esperanto word, that means "go with" or "follow". This name was
chosen because of the idea to keep following your code project with diagrams,
traceability, code quality and others.
